A command-line interface to a CBRAIN service
============================================

This repo contains a UNIX command-line interface (CLI) for [CBRAIN](https://github.com/aces/cbrain).

The interface is implemented in Python using standard network API libraries.

The main command is called "cbrain" and as is typical for such clients, works
with a set of subcommand and options (e.g. "cbrain file list -j")
